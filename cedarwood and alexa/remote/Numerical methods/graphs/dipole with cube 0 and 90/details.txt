changing U perametre of cube can change the distance between center of dipole and cube and eventually effect the radiation 

pattern as it is falling out of range. Radiation pattern with respect to (lambda/2,lambda) distance from center of 

cube to dipole are taken. Initially, the dipole radiation pattern is set to h=lambda/2.
